	I'm currently a computer science Post Doctorat at the GREYC laboratory. I defended my thesis in 2015 <a href="ressources/2015_thesis.pdf">[PDF]</a>. My thesis director, was <a href="https://elmoatazbill.users.greyc.fr/">Abder Elmoataz</a>. I work at GREYC laborary in image team and my Ph.D thesis subject was <span class="italic">``the processing of discrete data on surfaces and manifold to the application of 3D cultural heritage''</span>. These discrete data are information like coordinates, colors, temperatures or normals, which are available on images, 3D meshes or even 3D points clouds. We represent these data as valued functions on graphs. We use the Partial differential Equations (PdEs) to transcribe easily from continuous optimization problem to discrete optimization problems on graphs. Articles published show the usefulness of this framework to solve several tasks like filtering, simplification, inpainting, segmentation, on several cultural heritage objects.

Since 3-D color scanning has the potential to tackle a variety of traditional documentation challenges, the use of signal processing techniques on such data can be expected to yield new applications that are feasible for the first time with the aid of captured 3-D color point clouds. Our contributions are twofold. First, we propose a simple method to solve partial differential equations (PDEs) on point clouds using the framework of partial difference equations (PdEs) on graphs. Second, we survey several applications of 3-D color point cloud processing on real examples for which signal	processing researchers can develop tools that can be valuable for museum specialists.

With the recent advent of many 3D sensors, there is a growing interest in transposing and solving PDEs on surfaces and point clouds. In this paper, we propose a simple method to solve such PDEs using the framework of Partial difference Equations (PdEs) on graphs. This latter approach enables us to transcribe, for surfaces and point clouds, many models and algorithms designed for image processing. To illustrate our proposal, three problems are considered: p-Laplacian restoration and inpainting, PDEs Mathematical Morphology, and active contours segmentation.

We show the connections of this operator with local and nonlocal continuous normalized p-Laplacian. Then we consider the Dirichlet problem associated with theses operators and we prove the existence and the uniqueness of the solution. We show that our proposed operator is an extension on weighted graphs of the well known numerical approximation of Oberman of the 1-Laplacian and ∞-Laplacian .

	    <td class="td_article_description"><div class="article_description">We propose a method to process colored 3D point clouds. This method is based on several keys points: the use of graphs to represent 3D data, a formalization of the processing with Partial difference Equations (PdEs) on graphs, and the introduction of patches on 3D point clouds. We present exemples of denoising of either coordinate values or color values of point clouds obtained with 3D scanners. This work was funded under a Ph.D. grant of the regional council of Lower-Normandy.</div></td>

En particulier, on constate un intérêt croissant pour transposer des méthodes variationnelles et d'EDPs pour traiter des surfaces ou des données définis sur des surfaces. Dans nos travaux, nous nous intéressons également au traitement des images de points et de maillages de monuments 3D.</div></td>
